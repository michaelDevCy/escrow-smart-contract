This repository contains a Solidity smart contract that implements a secure escrow system on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract facilitates transactions between a buyer and a seller, with an escrow agent to mediate disputes.

## Features

- Secure fund deposit by the buyer
- Approval mechanism for both buyer and seller
- Dispute resolution by an escrow agent
- State management to track transaction progress
- Refund functionality for buyer protection

## Key Components

- Multi-party transaction management (buyer, seller, escrow agent)
- State machine for transaction flow control
- Event-driven architecture for dispute handling
- Modular design with role-based access control

This contract demonstrates advanced Solidity concepts and provides a foundation for building secure, decentralized escrow systems.
